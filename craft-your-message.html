            <h3>Organize Your Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Write your overall report goal in one to three sentences.  For example:  “I want to show the daily progress metrics.  Company employees will check this report multiple times a day to see how the team is doing.” This will come in handy when you begin your first draft of the report.</p>
            <p>Break down your report goal into sub-goals, or key points.  These will determine your content.  What message do you want to communicate on each page?</p>
            <p>Identify the highlights. If your audience has limited time to look through your report, ensure they get the main message. Remember that your perspective might be different from that of your audience.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Tell a Story</h3>
            <p>Storytelling helps your audience learn and absorb new information. The story of your report is the communication of your primary objective and sub-goals.</p>
            <p>Ensure that your report tells only a single story. Each page or section of a report should support the overall story, and not communicate different messages.</p>

            <li>Do you want to include an introduction, the main point, and a conclusion?</li>
            <li>Do you want to provide summary information, specific details, or both?</li>
